# Plot Myocardium Cube
### Author: Yunxiao Zhang

**Email: yunxiao9277@gmail.com**

This project visualizes a myocardium cube with detailed sheet illustrations, showing cross-sectional patterns of myocardial sheets on each face of the cube. The code allows for full customization of the cube and sheet properties, making it ideal for illustrating and studying the geometric relationships of myocardial sheets in a cubic configuration.
Features

- **Customizable Cube Size**: Adjust the size of the myocardium cube to fit your visualization needs.
- **Dynamic Sheet Colors**: Choose and modify the color schemes of the sheets, with support for smooth transitions and predefined color maps.
- **Customizable Fiber Angles**: Independently set the fiber angles of both the endocardium and epicardium to capture the anisotropic nature of myocardial fibers.
- **Adjustable Sheet Distances**: Control the spacing and distance between sheets to demonstrate various cross-sectional patterns.

### Usage

This project can be used to generate detailed visualizations of myocardial sheet orientations within a cube structure, making it ideal for biomedical illustrations, education, and research.
Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pyvista matplotlib
```

### Example Output

Below is an example of the generated myocardial cube with sheets visualized in a cross-sectional view:

Myocardium Cube
### How to Customize

- **Cube Size**: Modify the size of the cube by adjusting the relevant parameters in the code.
- **Sheet Colors**: Use either solid colors or gradient color maps (such as coolwarm) to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Fiber Angles**: Tweak the fiber angles for both the epicardium and endocardium to reflect realistic or experimental configurations.
- **Sheet Distance**: Adjust the sheet distance to control the appearance and spacing of each sheet layer.
